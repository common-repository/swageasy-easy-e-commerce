== Installation ==

## Automatic installation
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of SwagEasy, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “SwagEasy” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our e-commerce plugin, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

## Manual installation
The manual installation method involves downloading our e-commerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP client. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this.
